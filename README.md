# ProjectInertia
This is an open-source project to build a low-cost Commercial-Off-The-Shelf on-board computer for small CubeSat missions providing extremely low power usage and tolerance to radiation effects. At this point in time it is mostly a playground to test out new technologies and learn from it. The first hardware prototype [`iteration 1`](https://github.com/chrismolli/ProjectInertia/tree/main/hardware/iteration%201) is currently in production.

## Commercial-Off-The-Shelf in Space
The usage of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components in Space has been a topic of research for many years already due to the benefits of higher performance and lower costs, when compared to their radiation hardened counterparts.

However COTS components are subject to a manifold of radiation induced failure modes, that need to be considered during system design [[Sandia2018](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1481565)]. Destructive Latch-Up events are automatically detected and mitigated by a on-board circuit breaker. After a hold-down time of some dozen Âµs, the board is reconnected to the power source. This project proposes the use of a COTS microcontroller that is based on Ferro-Electric RAM. The Ferro-Electric RAM cell itself is resilient against various Single Event Effects [[Fetahovic2017](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322940214_Overview_of_radiation_effects_on_emerging_non-volatile_memory_technologies)]. However the peripherals within the respective integrated circuit might still experience Single Event Effects [[Bosser2018](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1483658)]. These will be recovered by the internal watchdog circuit, present in the microcontroller hardware.

Developing hard- and software for Space application does require a lot of careful design. Thus, this project aims for the most simple and very low cost design to minimize potential sources of faults.

## Hardware Development
The design is centered around the series of Ferroelectric-RAM based Microcontroller Units from Texas Instruments. The first prototype is using the [MSP430FR6972IPMR](https://www.ti.com/store/ti/en/p/product/?p=MSP430FR6972IPMR).

### Manufacturing
You can find the schematics, gerber files and bill of materials in the [hardware folder](https://github.com/chrismolli/ProjectInertia/tree/main/hardware).

## Firmware Development
The firmware is being developed using [Embedded Rust](http://www.rust-embedded.org) to explore the versatility of this language in a environment with extremely limited resources and the need for high reliability. Useful resources may be obtained from the [awesome embedded Rust list](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust).

### Peripheral Access Crate
The PAC has been succesfully created for the MSP430FR6972 chip used in prototype [`iteration 1`](https://github.com/chrismolli/ProjectInertia/tree/main/hardware/iteration%201).  
- [`msp430fr6972`](https://crates.io/crates/msp430fr6972) (beta) ![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/msp430fr6972)

### Application layer
In the first version only a few features shall be tested:
- Telemetry & Telecommand handling on UART (TODO)
- Configuration Storage in external Memory (TODO)
- Current Monitoring (TODO)

### Toolchain
The current toolchain uses:
- Rust `Edition 2018` (nightly)
- [`msp430-gcc-elf`](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE) compiler
- [`MSP430Ware`](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSPWARE) tools provided by Texas Instruments
  - `MSP430Flasher` JTAG flasher
